Collection of the Python Assignment Programs of 3rd Semester NSEC 

# Assignment Program Questions:
## Assignment 1:
1. Write a python program to display a message on the screen as follows.
We are the students from the dept. of Information Technology.
We are learning Python.
It is our odd semester.
2. Write a python program to convert a temperature in Celsius scale to its equivalent
Fahrenheit scale.
3. Write a python program to calculate the area and perimeter of a circle, a square and a
rectangle. Consider all the required information is preexistent.
4. Write a python program to find out the greatest among three integers.
5. Write a program to swap the value of two variables using a third variable and without
using a third variable.
6. Write a program to rotate the value of x, y, and z such that x has the value of y, y has the
value of z andz has the value of x.
7. Write a program to display the following numbers: 5678, 678, 78, 8, where the given number
is 5678.
8. Write a program to add two complex numbers by reading the numbers from the user.
9. Write a program to accept the principal amount, rate of interest, and duration from the
user. Calculate the interest amount and the total amount (principal + interest).
10. Write a program to calculate simple interest with the following conditions:
If the principal amount is less than 2,00,000 the interest rate is 10%.
If the principal amount is 2,00,000 -10,00,000 the interest rate is 12%.
If the principal amount is greater than 10,00,000 the interest rate is 15%
11. Write a python program to find out the roots of a quadratic equation and also find the type
of the roots.

## Assignment 2:
12) Write a python program to find out the Fibonacci series. The series length, N will be as per
user’s choice.
i.e., if N=10, then the series is
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.
13) Ask for a number N from the user. Now determine whether N is a member of the Fibonacci
series.
14) Enter a digit N and further find out the sum of (N + NN + NNN),
i.e., if N = 5, then sum = (5+55+555) = 615.

16) Print all the factors of any given number.
17) Find the factorial of a number entered by the user.
18) Write a program using a while loop to print all the odd numbers within a given range.
19) Write a program to compute the GCD and LCM of two integer numbers.
20) Find the prime numbers for a range that will be mentioned by the User.
21) Find the solution for the series given as (1/1! + 1/2! +1/3! + ….. + 1/N!).
The value of N will be mentioned by the User.
22) Check for any given number is Armstrong or not.
Note an Armstrong number is such a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits.
23) Write a program to check whether a given number is a prime number or not.
24) Write a program to find the sum of all prime numbers within a given range.
25) Write a program that prompts users to enter numbers. This process repeats until the
user enters -1. Finally, the program prints the count of prime and composite numbers
entered.

## Assignment 3:
26) Write a program to count the number of each vowel in a sentence.
27) Write a program to read a string and check whether the string is a palindrome or not.
28) Write a program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of the last
character havebeen changed to ‘*’, except the last character.
29) Write a program to count the occurrences of a word in a given sentence.
30) Write a program to detect whether two strings are anagrams or not.
31) Write a program to find the maximum and minimum of a list of numbers without
using built-in functions.
32) Write a program to find the union of two lists.
33) Write a program to concatenate two lists using list comprehension.
34) Write a program to ask the user to enter a file name with its proper extension and the
system will display the file extension only.
35) Create a list with at least 15 items and remove all duplicate items from that list.
36) Add the item 7000 after 6000 in the following Python List.
Given List: [10, 20, [300, 400, [5000, 6000], 500], 30, 40]
37) Extend a given nested list by adding the sub list ["h", "i", "j"] in such a way that it will
look like the following expected list.
Given_List: ["a", "b", ["c", ["d", "e", ["f", "g"], "k"], "l"], "m", "n"]
Expected_List: ['a', 'b', ['c', ['d', 'e', ['f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'], 'k'], 'l'], 'm', 'n']
38) Write a program to multiply two matrices as nested lists.
39) Write a program to create a list from two given lists ‘list1’ and ‘list2’ of numbers such
that it containsnumbers that are present in ‘list2’ but not in ‘list1’.
40) Write a program to find the distinct pair of numbers whose product is odd from a list of
integers.
41) Write a python program that will input the following information and store those in a tuple
and then print the entered information.
