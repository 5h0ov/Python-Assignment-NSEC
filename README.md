10. Write a program to calculate simple interest with the following conditions:
If the principal amount is less than 2,00,000 the interest rate is 10%.
If the principal amount is 2,00,000 -10,00,000 the interest rate is 12%.
If the principal amount is greater than 10,00,000 the interest rate is 15%
11. Write a python program to find out the roots of a quadratic equation and also find the type
of the roots.

## Assignment 2:
12) Write a python program to find out the Fibonacci series. The series length, N will be as per
user’s choice.
i.e., if N=10, then the series is
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.
13) Ask for a number N from the user. Now determine whether N is a member of the Fibonacci
series.
14) Enter a digit N and further find out the sum of (N + NN + NNN),
i.e., if N = 5, then sum = (5+55+555) = 615.

36) Add the item 7000 after 6000 in the following Python List.
Given List: [10, 20, [300, 400, [5000, 6000], 500], 30, 40]
37) Extend a given nested list by adding the sub list ["h", "i", "j"] in such a way that it will
look like the following expected list.
Given_List: ["a", "b", ["c", ["d", "e", ["f", "g"], "k"], "l"], "m", "n"]
Expected_List: ['a', 'b', ['c', ['d', 'e', ['f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'], 'k'], 'l'], 'm', 'n']
38) Write a program to multiply two matrices as nested lists.
39) Write a program to create a list from two given lists ‘list1’ and ‘list2’ of numbers such
